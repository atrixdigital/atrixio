# Atrix.io - Pakistan First Opensource digital Platform.


Atrix Digital SolutionsÂ© is building the Pakistan First opensource digital Platform that will be based on HEC database and NADRA smart Id,utilizing it by providing a platform for people of all genre to search people of the same locality, students of the same university residing nearby, Alumini search, People having the same taste, People with specific set of Skills or experience. 

This will not only enable people to communicate with students nearby and get work done easily. Technology should not replace one's social life, instead it should enhance real human interaction among each other. Atrix.io serves a lot of purpose and is built for all those who have completed their degree from any registered institute from HEC, They will be able to access the io and enjoy spaces. 

Geo tracking in Atrix.io is so advance and systematic and great that it will bring forward the new change. Generally speaking it is mainly build for University students and beyond. It is not specifically targeting the other audience.


### The main key feature of Atrix.io? 

The main key functionality of Atrix.io social module that will distinct it from other social platform(Facebook,twitter,etc), would be users ID verification. All those students who are registered with HEC database and as long as HEC have their record, They are member of the io and also corespond with NADRA's database.
Smart card provided by NADRA are also the pin point and io will utilize this for alot of purpose in future.


### Atrix.io as a learning Platform

ADS Academy that already is operating in Rawalpindi and Islamabad,Pakistan by allocating students and mentor to nearby resident and providing Learning camps and Virtual learning guide to student, will be mereged into io to create more authenticated system for registration. ADS Academy camps location and students who to invite will be easy to find with the HEC's API. 



#### What needs to be done to develop Atrix.io

It involves a lot of hard coding and we need many contributors to the system as it is open source,anyone can jump in and implement the functionality that they want or they can issue request. 

1. First is convincing government to support Atrix.io( mainly HEC and NADRA)
2. If approved, then we need to develop API for HEC and NADRA( highly secured) 
3. Getting Universities onboard to make io their main entry point for user data. 
4. Gathering investments and Cellular operators to join on board.
